# movie-roulette-app

This is a new and ongoing project I started to mimic a way of picking a movie to watch among friends.

## Road Map

Future versions will add animation of a spinning wheel that the user can trigger when the 'Spin' button is clicked.

## Movie API

Currently looking for an API to sync with the app so the user can look at trailers and ratings for the movies they pick.
